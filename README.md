This is the development repository of **Gyankriti ERP**

With the proliferation of the Internet, ERP systems like all the domains of Information Technology have known an important evolution.
Our ERP is just like any other ERP but it is developed using a modern and powerful framework that includes NODE.JS and AWS-SDK. Our system uses AJAX, JQUERY, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript on the client-side. On the server side, we are using various AWS services that are AWS-DynamoDB, AWS-SNS and AWS-elastic beanstalk used to host the website as well as the database. 
In 21st-century Information Technology plays a very important and crucial role in any sector. In our project, we are trying to automate most of the fundamental activities performed by the administration of an organization in a very cost-effective and scalable manner. Our ERP system automates most of the processes and provides greater accessibility to the information.
